		<h1 id="page-title">Lee Sin</h1>
		
		<p>A master of Ionia's ancient martial arts, Lee Sin is a principled fighter who 
		channels the essence of the dragon spirit to face any challenge. Though he lost 
		his sight many years ago, the warrior-monk has devoted his life to protecting his 
		homeland against any who would dare upset its sacred balance. Enemies who underestimate 
		his meditative demeanor will endure his fabled burning fists and blazing roundhouse 
		kicks.n</p>
